[!] Basic Description

This program is a separate 
program packaged in with the 
main Halcyon program to 
facilitate the communication 
between the web API and 
parsing that data to the end 
client.

This program is not required
for the end-user to have, as
the original implementation
in the main program provides
that it will attempt to guess
the version info by itself.

[!] MISC

This project is a work in 
progress.
